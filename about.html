        <h1>IT IS NOT JUST COFFEE...</h1>
        <p>At Starbarako, strength isn't about being loud or pushing people around.
           It's about standing firm in your values, leading with kindness, and respecting everyone's choices.
           We welcome the early risers chasing dreams and the night owls searching for peace.
           Come as you are, no pressure. Just real people, real stories, and real coffee.
           Starbarako. Strong brew. Soft heart. </p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Starbarako was born from the heart of the hardworking, those who grind every day with strength, pride, and purpose.
           Inspired by the bold spirit of the Filipino barako, we created more than just a coffee shop.
            We built a space where toughness meets warmth. From day one, 
            our mission has been simple, to serve coffee as strong as our will, and as warm as our care for others.
