        <h1>IT IS NOT JUST COFFEE...</h1>
        <p>At Starbucks, it is more than just a cup. It is that morning boost before a long day, the break you need in the middle of the hustle, or the reason you sit down and catch up with someone you’ve missed. We make coffee that fits right into real life warm, honest, and just what you need, when you need it. </p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Starbucks started in 1971 at Seattle’s Pike Place Market, selling fresh coffee beans and tea.
            In 1982, Howard Schultz joined and later brought the idea of coffee shops from Italy to the U.S.
            Since then, Starbucks has grown around the world, serving millions of people every day.
            Our goal is simple, it is to bring people together over a great cup of coffee.</p>
